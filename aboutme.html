                    <p>I have recently moved from London to Bristol to work towards my dream job in wildlife production. Growing up on the edge of a National Trust Woodland with a badger set at the bottom of my garden (and having a pet chameleon called Carlos!), it is easy to see where my obsession with nature stems. My passion for wildlife led me to study at the University of Leeds, where I gained a BSc in Zoology and an MSc in Biodiversity and conservation.

                        Photography and filmmaking have always been activities that I have enjoyed in my spare time. I aspire to tell stories through my camera lens to educate and inspire people about the issues our wildlife is facing. Over the last few years, I have actively worked to develop my skill set to take my love of creating wildlife content from a hobby into a professional career.
                        
                        Outside of work and wildlife, you will find me attempting to cold water swim, playing netball, or spending too much money in coffee shops.
